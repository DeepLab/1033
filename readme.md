#1,033 Randomly Selected Objects from the Pentagon 1033 Program

Trying to wrap your head around the scale of the Pentagon's 1033 program can be difficult. Lots of news websites have made useful tools for getting some big-picture numbers--*how many MRAPs and where? What does my specific county have?* But I kind of just wanted to understand the program as a bunch of *stuff* and try and wrap my head around the stuff of it. 

Trying to look at all nearly 200,000 objects in the DoD's spreadsheets was equally overwhelming (and crashed my browser). So I made a thing that lets you look through 1,033 randomly selected entries from the program. (It might still crash your browser, sorry.) It gives you an idea of the kind of range of items the program distributed (from PLASTIC BAG and MEN'S SHIRTS to NIGHT VISION GOGGLES) and what items tend to show up a lot (it seems like there are a ton of rifles). It's also kind of an interesting way to browse the dataset. 

Next step: adding images maybe? Other things. I don't know.
